          <p>Dear Anisha</p>
          <hr>
          <p>[The date when we were arguing with Naari, and the day I heard your voice]</p>
<br>
          <p>You were just a small baby‚Äîwhen I heard you talk for the first time in the VC, I honestly thought you were a kid. The day Naari heard your voice and said, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a star?‚Äù and the way you were worried about it‚Ä¶ man, that day I felt like covering you with my wings. I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing, but something about you made me want to care and protect you, even though I didn‚Äôt know you well back then.</p>

          <p>But eventually, when I started talking to you, it felt close‚Äîas if I were speaking with someone I‚Äôd known for a hundred years.</p>

          <p>The way you explained how your kids would be, and how you‚Äôd dress for the PTM, and I jumped in saying, ‚ÄúWhat if the husband comes on a sports bike in a suit?‚Äù‚Äîthat was funny but also a little embarrassing for me.</p>
<br>
          <p>I wanted to be a part of every chapter of your life. I wanted to share every happiness you experienced. When I said ‚Äúkuch dik raha hai kya‚Äù while sending my childhood pic, I still smile remembering how beautiful your laugh was. I wanted to hear that laugh at every moment‚Äînot just hear it, but cherish it, and let it bring joy to my heart.</p>

          <p>Your memories keep flooding in. I‚Äôve started imagining a beautiful life with you. Maybe I sound stupid, but hey‚Äîit is what it is. After hearing your story, most would‚Äôve probably walked away. But I stayed. Even though I questioned myself, here‚Äôs the thing: I wanted to change you. People might have a bad perspective about you, but I don‚Äôt. I stayed because I want you to be the best version of yourself. I couldn‚Äôt leave a kind-hearted angel alone, could I?</p>

          <p>Sometimes I imagine surprising you by riding a bike all the way to Nepal just to meet you. For that, I‚Äôd earn enough money, build up my courage, and mostly‚Äîgain self-confidence.</p>
<br>
          <p>I don‚Äôt know how others describe angels, but here I am‚Äîdescribing mine.</p>
<br>
          <p>Her eyes are like the evening sea, bringing calm every time you look into them.  
          Her voice is like light in the middle of lost darkness.  
          Her face is like a mirror‚Äîevery time I see it, it reflects my life.  
          Her behavior is like a flower surrounded by grass‚Äîdelicate, beautiful, and gentle.</p>

    <p>The day when you expressed that you like me, honestly the only thought I got was ‚Äúthis is never gonna work.‚Äù</p>

    <p>I said I wasn‚Äôt ready for all that ‚Äî even I doubted myself. But after spending those hours with you, through all those meaningful, deep conversations‚Ä¶ it really feels like there‚Äôs no need to rush.</p>

    <p>We can do a lot of things together! We can call, do pranks, play games online, make videos and upload them‚Ä¶ there are endless possibilities.</p>

    <p>I‚Äôm improving every single day, and I know I‚Äôll achieve all my goals. And I genuinely wish for great success in your future too.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I know I‚Äôm childish sometimes, but hey ‚Äî I‚Äôm not like that with everyone :)</p>

    <p>If you think this is too much, well‚Ä¶ no worries, because I thought the same ‚Äî LOL.</p>

    <p>But here‚Äôs the thing: you can do whatever you want, for I‚Äôm with you.</p>
    <br>


    <p>With loveeeee,  
    <br>Srujan aka Flash ü•µ</p>
